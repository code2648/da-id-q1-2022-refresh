**Lab tasks will cover following navigation excercise**

DMS labs has two flavors:
1) If you want to have dive deep hands-on in DMS (Data Migration Service) then first run instructor lab to mimic on-prem relational database environment, followed by student lab to create required data-migration infrastructure in cloud. The main lab help you to perform actual data migration from relational database to AWS data-lake. 
2) If you directly want to start with Glue ETL and skip DMS hands-on, please run DMS auto-complete lab. Autocomplete lab may take between 15 to 20 minutes to avail all data in centralize S3 data lake raw layer and you will be ready to dive-deep on data transformation using Glue ETL.
